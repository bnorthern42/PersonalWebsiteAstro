      <p>
          I specialize in building systems that bridge high-performance computing and modern software engineering. My work spans distributed simulations, backend services, and developer tools—always with a focus on performance, scalability, and improving engineering workflows.

          I’ve optimized memory layouts for large-scale simulations, developed backend services that handle real-world complexity, and created tools that streamline day-to-day tasks for engineers. Beyond my professional work, I bring the same analytical mindset to swing trading and explore new ideas through game tech projects.
